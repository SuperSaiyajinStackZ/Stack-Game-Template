# Stack-Game-Template
This is a template for the homebrew games i do such as 3DEins, 3DVier and 3DZwei.

## Games
### All of those Games are made by me, but some are part of Universal-Team. You'll find games I've being working on below.

- [3DEins - An UNO Cardgame clone.](https://github.com/Universal-Team/3DEins)
- [3DVier - A Connect-Four clone.](https://github.com/Universal-Team/3DVier)
- [3DZwei - A Memory Cardgame clone.](https://github.com/SuperSaiyajinStackZ/3DZwei)

All of these projects use [Universal-Core](https://github.com/Universal-Team/Universal-Core) as their submodule.

This requires devkitARM, Libctru, Citro2D & Citro3D by [devkitPro](https://github.com/devkitPro). If you don't have it, you can use devkitPro pacman to get them. The command for that would be `pacman -S 3ds-dev`, if on Windows. The command changes some bit on other platforms.
